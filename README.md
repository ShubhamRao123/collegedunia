# Task: Implement College Table with Infinite Scroll and Sorting Features
Overview:

This task involves creating a table layout to display college data with functionalities such as infinite scroll, sorting, and search. You will work with a dummy JSON dataset of different colleges and implement various features to enhance the user experience.
# Requirements:

  Table Layout: Create a table structure as shown in the provided image.
        Initially, display 10 rows in the table.
        Additional rows should load dynamically as the user scrolls (infinite scroll functionality).
        If a college has a featured flag with a truthy value, display a "Featured" label next to the college name.

  Dummy JSON Data: Use a mock JSON dataset representing various colleges. Each entry should contain relevant information like college name, rating, fees, user review ratings, and a featured flag.

   Functionality to Add:

  Sorting: Add sorting options for:
            Collegedunia rating
            Fees
            User review rating

  Sorting should work for both ascending and descending order.

  Search: Implement a search bar to filter colleges by name.

  Infinite Scroll: Load additional data as the user scrolls down the table.

Expected Outcome:

  A fully functional, responsive table displaying college data.
    Efficient search and sorting mechanisms.
    Smooth infinite scrolling experience.
